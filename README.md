My name is James Connor, and I created this app to give MoMath a digital tour guide. It allows visitors to explore the different exhibits and learn about the different parts of MoMath, all while searching for hidden AR codes throughout the museum. It uses riddles and objects that have to do with exhibits to point guests in different directions. I truly hope that you like my submission, and that you consider it for future use.
